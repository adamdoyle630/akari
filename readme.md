# Akari Light Up
## About
This app is a culminating project for one of my software engineering courses at UNC Chapel Hill. It is a replica of Akari Light Up, a game where the user must click cells on a grid to place lamps. The goal is to light every corridor cell, where all "clue" cells are satisfied and no lamp lights another lamp. Light stops when it is blocked by a wall cell. The original product was published by Japanese publisher Nikoli, which can be found here: https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/

This app was created as a Maven project using Java JDK 17.0.1 and the JavaFX library and incorporates the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
